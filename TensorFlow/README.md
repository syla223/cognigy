# TensorFlow.js

This module shows how to use any TensorFlow.js model in Custom Module on the example of toxicity model.

First, go to https://www.tensorflow.org/js/models and find a model that you would like to use in your Custom Module. Follow the instructions in the model's documentation.

## Installation

You will need to install the libraries with npm:

```bash
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow-models/model_name
```

## Usage

You can use this templet to create a Custom Module for cognigy.

Import your model using `require()` and create a function based on the model's documentation.

In order to get the text message from IFlowInput, use `input.input.text`.Then, you can apply model's functions on your input.

To save the result in the context of the message use `input.actions.addToContext()`. 

Creating yout package.json, remember to include
```	bash
"scripts": {
		"build": "tsc -p .",
		"zip": "npm run build && zip test.zip build/* package.json package-lock.json README.md icon.png icon-large.png"
	},
```

Then, you can create a zip.test with all necessary files with
```bash
npm run zip
```
from your terminal.

You can find more informations about creating Custom Module in cognigy [docs](https://docs.cognigy.com/docs/integration-framework).


## TensorFlow to JavaScript

It is possible to convert any TensorFlow SavedModel, TensorFlow Hub module, Keras HDF5 or tf.keras SavedModel into TensorFlow.js. In order to do that follow the steps described [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/tree/master/tfjs-converter).
